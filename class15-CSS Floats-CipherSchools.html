            A paragraph is a series of raised sentences developing a central 
                    idea, called the topic. Try to think about paragraphs in terms of 
                    thematic unity: a paragraph is a sentence or a group of sentences 
                    that supports one central, unified idea. Paragraphs add one idea 
                    at a time to your broader argument.
