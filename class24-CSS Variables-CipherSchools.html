    <p>
        A paragraph is a series of raised sentences developing a central 
        idea, called the topic. Try to think about paragraphs in terms of 
        thematic unity: a paragraph is a sentence or a group of sentences 
        that supports one central, unified idea. Paragraphs add one idea 
        at a time to your broader argument.
